# 3D-Coordinate-Rotation

This is a proof of concept application I made back in 2017 to showcase 3D Coordinate Rotations

Controls:

  Use W, A, S, D keys to alter the X and Y axis of the cube.
  
  Use R, F keys to alter the Z axis of the cube.
  
  Use the arrows keys to alter the rotation of the cube.
